We do not process our Ghee / Clarified butter from the cream of milk. Instead, we use our age-old method of curdling the milk and churning it slowly in a bi-directional way, to separate the buttermilk and butter.
This pure butter is heated on a low flame to produce 100% pure Ghee. Ghee prepared using this method has the perfect aroma, texture, colour and flavour. And it also retains the maximum nutrition.
 Burst the myth about Ghee: 
There has always been a myth that Ghee makes you fat, induces cholesterol and high blood pressure. The answer is No. Ghee is the purest form of consumable animal fat which is in fact much better than refined vegetable oil. Ghee increases the good fat in your body which is much required to lead a healthy energetic life. It aids in reducing LDL and triglycerides (bad cholesterol).
Experience the taste of 100% pure Ghee.
